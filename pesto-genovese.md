# Pesto alla Genovese
The original rendition of the now widespread Italian pasta sauce hails from the city of Genova. I don't know much more about it.

## Ingredients
* 4 cups basil leaf
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1/2 cup Parmigiano Reggiano
* 1/2 cup Pecorino Romano
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1/4 cup pine nuts

## Instructions
* Add the leaves and pine nuts into a food processor and blend into a fine paste
* Add the seasoning and olive oil and blend until the colour darkens
